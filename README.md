# Marketing Customer Analysis

This project explores company data on customer purchasing behaviors. Within the data, we can observe customer characteristics such as their age, tenure with the company, and their item purchase and channel preferences. The `01_eda.ipynb` notebook dives into the process of cleaning the data and conducting an RFM analysis to identify customer segments that we will later use to target our audience. In `02_modeling.ipynb`, we incorporate these RFM clusters along with the other features we have available to predict whether customers would respond to our advertisement campaigns. During the modeling process, we observed a prominent class imbalance which led to further experimentation beyond our baseline model. Within this notebook, we have provided some insights that would best target specific target audiences to be more likely to respond to our marketing campaigns.
